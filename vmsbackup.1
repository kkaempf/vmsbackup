.TH VMSBACKUP 1 
.SH NAME
vmsbackup \- read a VMS backup tape
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vmsbackup
.B \-{tx}[cdevwB][s setnumber][f tapefile][b blocksize]
[ name ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I vmsbackup 
reads a VMS generated backup tape, converting the files
to Unix format and writing the files to disc.
The default operation of the program is to go through an entire
tape, extracting every file and writing it to disc.
This may be modified by the following options.
.TP 8
.B b blocksize
Use blocksize as the blocksize to read the saveset with.
.TP 8
.B B
Extract files in binary mode.
.TP 8
.B c
Use complete filenames, including the version number.
A colon and the octal version number will be appended to all filenames.
A colon, rather than a semicolon, is used since the Unix Shell
uses the semicolon as the line separator.
Using a colon prevents the user from having to escape the semicolon
when referencing the filename.
This option is useful only when multiple versions of the same file
are on a single tape or when a file of the same name already
exists in the destination directory.
The default is to ignore version numbers.
.TP 8
.B d
use the directory structure from VMS, the default value is off.
.TP 8
.B e
Process all filename extensions.
Since this program is mainly intended to move source code and possibly
data from a DEC system to a Unix system, the default is to ignore
all files whose filename extension specifies system dependent data.
The file types which will be ignored, unless the
.B e
option is specified, are
.IP "" 10
exe     VMS executable file
.br
lib     VMS object library file
.br
obj     RSX object file
.br
odl     RSX overlay description file
.br
olb     RSX object library file
.br
pmd     RSX post mortem dump file
.br
stb     RSX task symbol table file
.br
sys     RSX bootable system file
.br
tsk     RSX executable task file
.PP
.TP 8
.B f
Use the next argument in the command line as the tape device to
be used, rather than the default.
.sp
If vmsbackup is compiled with the remote tape option
and the file name has the form
.IR system [. user ]:/dev/???
.I vmsbackup
will use the tape drive /dev/??? on the remote system
.IR system ,
via
.IR rsh (1),
and
.IR rmt (8).
The optional
.I user
portion of the pathname specifies the login name to use on the
remote system.
If it is not supplied, the current user's login name will be used.
In all the cases, the user must have the appropriate
permissions on the remote machine, in order to use this facility.
The default is
.I /dev/rmt8
(drive 0, raw mode, 1600 bpi).
This must be a raw mode tape device.
.TP 8
.B s saveset
Process only the given saveset number.
.TP 8
.B t
Produce a table of contents (a directory listing) on the standard output
of the files on tape.
.TP 8
.B v
Verbose output.
Normally
.I vmsbackup 
does its work silently.
The verbose option will cause the filenames of the files being read from
tape to disk to be output on the standard output.
.TP 8
.B w
.I vmsbackup
prints the action to be taken followed by file name, then
wait for user confirmation. If a word beginning with `y'
is given, the action is done. Any other input means don't do it.
.TP 8
.B x
extract the named files from the tape.
.TP 8
The optional 
.I name
argument specifies one or more filenames to be
searched for specifically on the tape and only those files are to be processed.
The name may contain the usual sh(1) meta-characters *?![] \nnn.
.SH FILES
