Changes in 4.3: (kkaempf@gmail.com)

* convert source code to ANSI C, fix signedness for getu{16,32}

* add hexdump function for debugging

* add descriptive dtype names for debugging

* implement time conversion (for non-VMS systems)

Changes since version 4.1: (kth@srv.net)

* Use the include files <descrip.h> and <fabdef.h> instead of many
hard coded constants. It must now be compiled with the
'-fdollars-in-identifiers' flag because of this.

* Added handling of dates/times. It now needs to be linked against
the 'starlet' library.

* Add file creation date to the -t printout.

* Modify the -F option so that it more closely resembles a DIR/FULL
listing from a real VMS 5.5-2 system, and add several missing
items (Dates, file id, various attributes, etc).

* Added a '-D' flag so that I didn't have to keep switching between
the DEBUG version and the regular version (Only does anything when
the program is compiled with DEBUG defined).

* Rewrote the Makefile because I couldn't get the original to work.

* Increased the size of the date strings from 23 to 24 to make room
for the terminating NULL.

* Modified so it doesn't die when given a RSTS/E save set.

* Able to use getopt_long for long option names.

Changes since version 3.0.1:

* Merged in changes from version 3.1 from S.J. Tappin of the
University of Birmingham.  .HLB is now on the list of file extensions
which are ignored by default (along with .TLB, .EXE, etc.).  Filenames
are matched in a case-insensitive fashion.  Added -B option to
extract files in binary mode.

* Merged in the -b change from Timothy Stark's version 4.0.  This lets
one set the blocksize.

Changes from version 3.0 to version 3.0.1:

* The output from listings now more closely approximates the output of
VMS BACKUP/LIST.

* There is now a version which runs on VMS and accepts (a few) of the
qualifiers of BACKUP.

* Can read savesets on disk (created with the /SAVE_SET qualifier) as
well as on tape.

* More portable (in particular, no longer depends on things like
#ifdef sun to determined byte-order, and no longer depends on the
size of host data types like short and long).

Changes which were in version 3.0:

(Version 3.0 is also known as "v07i099: Read VMS backup tapes"
(read-vms-backs) from the comp.sources.unix archive)

* See the bottom of the ChangeLog file.
